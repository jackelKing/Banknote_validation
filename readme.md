# 🏦 Banknote Authentication Predictor

A **Gradio-based web app** that predicts whether a banknote is **Genuine** ✅ or **Fake** ❌ based on 4 key features: Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, and Entropy.  

It also provides **interactive 2D and 3D visualizations** of the input and existing clusters.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 Predicts **Genuine** or **Fake** banknotes.
- 📊 **2D Plot**: Variance vs Skewness.
- 🌐 **3D Plot**: Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis.
- ⚡ Uses **KMeans clustering** with automatic cluster-to-class mapping.
- ☁️ Deployment-ready for **Render** or any cloud platform.
